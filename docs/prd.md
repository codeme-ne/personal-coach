## Narrative

Sarah opens Personal Coach every morning as part of her routine. She quickly scans her list of five daily habits: "Morning meditation," "Drink 8 glasses of water," "Read for 30 minutes," "Exercise," and "Journal before bed." She taps the checkbox next to "Morning meditation" and watches her 23-day streak increase to 24 days, feeling a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue. Throughout the day, she returns to the app to mark habits complete as she achieves them. When she wants to add a new habit, she simply taps the floating action button and enters the details in a clean, focused modal. The app feels like a supportive companion in her personal development journey, providing clear visual feedback and celebrating her consistency without overwhelming her with complexity. At the end of the week, she long-presses on her exercise habit to view the calendar history, seeing a visual representation of her commitment and identifying patterns that help her optimize her routine.
