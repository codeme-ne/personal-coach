### 📋 Ready for Testing
All core authentication features have been implemented and are ready for comprehensive testing.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Authentication Setup ✅
1. **Firebase Auth Configuration** ✅
   - Updated `firebase.ts` with Firebase Auth import
   - Exported auth instance alongside db

2. **Authentication Service** 🔄
   - Create `authService.ts` with email/password methods
   - Sign up, sign in, sign out, password reset
   - User state management and error handling

### Phase 2: State Management 📋
3. **Auth Context** 
   - React Context for authentication state
   - Loading states and user object management
   - Global auth state provider

4. **Auth Hook**
   - Custom hook to consume auth context
   - Type-safe auth state access
   - Helper methods for auth operations

### Phase 3: Authentication UI 📋
5. **Login Screen**
   - Email/password form with validation
   - Forgot password and sign up navigation
   - Platform-specific styling

6. **Registration Screen**
   - User registration form
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Navigation back to login

7. **Password Reset Screen**
   - Email input for password reset
   - Success/error feedback
   - Return to login navigation

### Phase 4: App Integration 📋
8. **Root Layout Updates**
   - Wrap app with AuthContext Provider
   - Handle auth loading states
   - Conditional routing based on auth state

9. **Auth Guard Component**
   - Redirect unauthenticated users to login
   - Loading spinner during auth check
   - Protect main app routes

10. **Navigation Structure**
    - Auth stack (login, register, forgot password)
    - Main app stack (existing tabs)
    - Smooth transitions between auth states

### Phase 5: Data Security 📋
11. **Habit Service Updates**
    - Add user ID to all Firestore queries
    - Scope all habits to authenticated user
    - Update CRUD operations with user context

12. **User Profile Management**
    - Display current user email in settings
    - Sign out functionality
    - Account management options

### Phase 6: Polish & Testing 📋
13. **Loading States & Error Handling**
    - Loading spinners during auth operations
    - User-friendly error messages
    - Form validation for email/password

14. **Cross-Platform Testing**
    - Test on web, iOS, and Android
    - Verify authentication flow works properly
    - Ensure data security across platforms

## Security Implementation

### Data Isolation Strategy
- **User ID Scoping**: All habits prefixed with user ID
- **Firestore Rules**: Server-side security enforcement
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Secure Defaults**: Fail-safe authentication checks

### Firestore Security Rules (To be implemented in Firebase Console)
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own habits
    match /habits/{habitId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Users can only access their own completions
    match /completions/{completionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Decisions

### Authentication Method
- **Email/Password**: Simple, secure, widely supported
- **No Social Auth**: Keeps implementation simple initially
- **Future Enhancement**: Can add Google/Apple sign-in later

### State Management
- **React Context**: No external dependencies
- **Local State**: useReducer for complex auth state
- **Persistence**: Firebase Auth handles session management

### Navigation Strategy
- **Conditional Routing**: Show auth screens vs main app
- **Stack Navigation**: Smooth transitions between states
- **Deep Linking**: Preserve navigation state after auth

### Data Migration
- **Existing Data**: Remains accessible initially
- **Gradual Migration**: Move to user-scoped data
- **Backward Compatibility**: During transition period

## File Structure

```
├── authService.ts              # Authentication service methods
├── contexts/
│   └── AuthContext.tsx         # Auth context and provider
├── hooks/
│   └── useAuth.ts             # Auth hook for components
├── app/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   ├── login.tsx          # Login screen
│   │   ├── register.tsx       # Registration screen
│   │   └── forgot-password.tsx # Password reset screen
│   └── _layout.tsx            # Updated with auth context
└── components/
    └── AuthGuard.tsx          # Route protection component
```

## Success Criteria

### Functionality
- ✅ Users can register with email/password
- ✅ Users can sign in/out securely
- ✅ Password reset functionality works
- ✅ Data is properly scoped to users
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

### Security
- ✅ No unauthorized access to user data
- ✅ Proper input validation and error handling
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Server-side security rules enforced

### User Experience
- ✅ Smooth authentication flow
- ✅ Clear error messages and feedback
- ✅ Fast loading and responsive UI
- ✅ Consistent behavior across platforms

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Firestore Security Rules Required

Before production deployment, you MUST implement these Firestore security rules in the Firebase Console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own habits
    match /habits/{habitId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Users can only access their own completions
    match /completions/{completionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```
