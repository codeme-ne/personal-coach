# 🚀 Firebase Authentication Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All authentication features have been successfully implemented and are ready for deployment.

## 🔧 Firebase CLI Setup Complete

- ✅ Firebase CLI installed locally (v13.15.4 - compatible with Node.js 18)
- ✅ Firebase project configuration created (`.firebaserc`)
- ✅ Firestore security rules prepared (`firestore.rules`)
- ✅ Database indexes optimized (`firestore.indexes.json`)
- ✅ Firebase configuration file created (`firebase.json`)
- ✅ NPM scripts added for easy deployment

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Manual Steps Required

Since we can't perform browser authentication in this environment, you need to complete these steps on your local machine:

### 1. Authenticate with Firebase (REQUIRED)

```bash
npm run firebase:login
# or
npx firebase login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate with your Google account.

### 2. Deploy Security Rules (CRITICAL)

```bash
npm run firebase:rules
# or
npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**⚠️ Your app will NOT work properly until this step is completed!**

### 3. Deploy Database Indexes (Recommended)

```bash
npm run firebase:deploy
# or
npx firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Authentication

After deploying the security rules:

### 1. Start Your App
```bash
npm start
# or
npx expo start --web
```

### 2. Test Registration Flow
- Create a new account with email/password
- Verify you're redirected to the main app
- Check that your email appears in Settings

### 3. Test Login Flow
- Sign out from Settings
- Sign back in with your credentials
- Verify habits persist and are scoped to your user

### 4. Test Data Isolation
- Create a second account with different email
- Verify each account has its own separate habits
- Confirm users cannot see each other's data

### 5. Test Password Reset
- Use "Forgot Password" on login screen
- Check your email for reset link
- Verify reset functionality works
